                      In order to create an effective learning experience, 
                      the designer needs to be familiar with both 
                      domain-specific content and relevant instructional 
                      techniques. For this project, the relevant content 
                      was leadership skills. Our review of the literature, 
                      looking at over 80 sources spanning management science,
                      leadership training, and learning science literatures,
                      revealed a focus on the factors affecting transfer, 
                      or learners' ability to translate instruction to 
                      application. Moving forward, this literature served 
                      as a reference in our attempts to identify the 
                      features of instruction which best facilitate transfer.

                  Our data collection process left us with tens of hours of raw video and audio recordings on top of pages of notes and spreadsheets. As part of the journey from raw data to synthesized findings, which would ultimately inform our design ideas, we used a 4-step process of analysis:

                        Compile quotes and observations from audio recordings and interview notes in a spreadsheet. This technique facilitates synthesis of the data, since the reader can look across one row and see the full set of answers across interviews to one question.

                        Review and interpret the raw data as a group. While the spreadsheet helped us organize a vast set of data, this process helped us begin to identify the more relevant points from each data source.

                        Model individual data sources. For a selectzion of data sources, we used contextual inquiry modelling techniques to identify proccesses and patterns of interaction. This allowed us to identify trends across individuals as well as draw insights regarding key areas of opportunity or breakdown.

                         In order to synthesize across our various data sources and models, we iteratively clustered and categorized our data points using an affinity diagramming process. This allowed us to extract high value abstractions and trends.

                Using our research findings as our primary guidelines, we followed an iterative ideation process to lead towards a small set of product recommendations. We began by identifying a product feature space that satisfies the core needs of the learner. We analyzed the theory and common practice around each of these potential features to support our initial valuation of each idea. This supported our subsequent ideation which led to a set of initial product concepts which are currently being developed and validated.
